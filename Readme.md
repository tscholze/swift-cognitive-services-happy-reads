## What's this?
This is a simple use case and play-around app to use the [Microsoft Cogntive Service](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis) Text API. It parses the English version of the [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097) news and calculates the happiness.

## Features
1. It compiles
1. It will split the news into *happy* and *unhappy* ones

## How to run
1. Create a free trail [Microsoft Cognitive Services account](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up)
1. Copy and paste the Text API service key to the `ApiKey`property in the `CognitiveService.swift` file
1. Run `pod install` to install external dependencies
1. Run the project
