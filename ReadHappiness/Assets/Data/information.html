          <strong>What is it?</strong>
          <i>Happy Read</i> is an iOS app that uses the English feed of the great <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097">Deutsche Welle</a> news feed. 
          It enriches the feed articles with a happiness score provided by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis">Microsoft Cognitive Services</a>.
          That means, that the user is able to choose wether the user want to read happy or unhappy articles. False positive articles are possbile.
      </p>
     
      <p>
          <strong>Why?</strong>
          This app is targeted to work as a play ground for the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis">Microsoft Cognitive</a> and (in future) other cloud-based services. 
          There is no commercial purpose behind this usecase.
      </p>
